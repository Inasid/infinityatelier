Founded by Jyoti Nahata, the studio specializes in transitional design, blending diverse styles and eras to create timeless, harmonious spaces. Its design philosophy revolves around merging the classic with the contemporary, bringing together eclectic elements to reflect both history and modernity.

                Infinity Atelier emphasizes the use of local materials and craftsmanship, ensuring that every project resonates with the unique spirit of Kolkata. The studio works closely with local artisans and uses traditional techniques, such as hand-carved wood, jute, and stone, while incorporating modern finishes and sensibilities to cater to the changing needs of contemporary living. This approach creates spaces that are not only aesthetically appealing but also deeply rooted in the cultural and historical context of the region.</div>
